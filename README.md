# BetterFramework-Summary
A proposed template for a better framework/library summary. This is based off the efforts of Mike Morrison. The credit goes to him for this work. I just did a small modification to it to make it useful for dev work.

This work is derived from the work of Mike Morrison as published and licensed here:

The same license at Mike used was duplicated here. I believe I have adhered to all requirements of the license, and I deeply appreciate the work of Mike Morrison. I appreciate his open contribution of this.
